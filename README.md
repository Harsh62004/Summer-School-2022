# Summer-School-2022
This repository contains all my work from the workshop on Machine Learning and the Basics of Neural Networks.

IEEE Student Branch of DAIICT organized the Summer School '22 - Workshop on Machine Learning and the Basics of Neural Networks. It was an extremely fruitful workshop where we were taught from scratch till the level from which we can make our own projects. This workshop covered all the fundamentals of ML and neural networks.
